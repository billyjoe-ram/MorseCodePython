# Python Morse Code
Repo created to automate translations
from and to morse code of messages in english.

This repository will help people to learn
and understand more about this form
of communication widely used.

## What is Morse Code?
According to Wikipedia, morse code, named
after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of
the telegraph, "is a
method used in telecommunication to encode
text characters as standardized sequences of
two different signal durations, called dots
and dashes, or dits and dahs."

"The dit duration is the basic unit of time
measurement in morse code transmission.
The duration of a dah is three
times the duration of a dit. Each dit or dah
within an encoded character is followed by
a period of signal absence, called a space,
equal to the dit duration."

Also, there is no distinction between upper
and lower case letters  when communicating
by _morse_.
